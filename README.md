# ConsoleSnake
## =========================================

 A simple snake game.

 -Uses Conio.h for the Dos version
 
 -Uses Ncurses for the Linux version

# To compile the linux version you'll need to install ncurses library.
 
# On Ubuntu: 
 apt-get install libncurses5-dev
 
# On Arch:
 pacman -Syu libncurses5-dev.

# Note:
 As Turbo C/C++ is a very old compiler it produces a 16-bit executable, which you would not be able to run on 64-bit windows thus,
 you're gonna need DOSBox or any similar DOS emulator to play the game.
