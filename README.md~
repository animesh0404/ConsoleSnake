# ConsoleSnake
##=========================================

# A simple snake game written in Turbo C.

# Note:
## As Turbo C/C++ is a very old compiler it produces a 16-bit executable, which you would not be able to run on 64-bit windows thus,
## you're gonna need DOSBox or any similar DOS emulator to play the game.
